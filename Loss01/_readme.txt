This is the collection of source codes for direct 0-1 loss optimization
in binary classification. This work is licensed under GPLv3, which grants 
you the freedom to use, change and share the codes in any way you like. 
Please cite our paper if you use this code: Tan Nguyen, Scott Sanner, 
"Algorithms for Direct 0–1 Loss Optimization in Binary Classification", 
in proceddings of 30th ICML 2013.
======================================================================

Sorry the codes are not well organized and commented. When have time I 
will reorganize them. For the time being please use the guide below.

To run the codes in MatLab, first add the "libs" folder to the running path
(e.g. by right click on it, select Add to Path, then Selected Folders and Subfolders)

Then go through main.m to see how to call the optimizers.

Running main.m should produce a graph showing decision hyperplanes of 
different optimizer for a sample data (note where the data is and how is formatted).

All main*.m are runnable. They provide graphical visualisation of optimizers.

All test*.m are runnable. They are tests that provided comparisons in the paper.

Any question please send email to tan1889@gmail.com
